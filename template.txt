MMM NES Starterpack

This starterpack provides you with the full interface inspired by Day of the Tentacle and includes the Edison Mansion as seen in the NES version of Maniac Mansion.
This staterpack was never fully completed so use with caution.
Read midi.txt in your games root directory on how to setup MIDI support.

Have fun!
